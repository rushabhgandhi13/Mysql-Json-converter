#### About the project
The project is a partial implementation to the research paper( [link](https://github.com/rushabhgandhi13/Mysql-Json-converter/blob/main/Ieee_paper.pdf "link") ). the code connects to the mysql server and dynamically fetches all the existing database. it then prompts to select one database on selection of the databse it fetchs all the tables existing in the databse selected and shows a prompt to select a table you want to convert into json and on selection of the table it displays all the json objects which are converted. And the finally the data gets stored in the demo.json file in the same directory.
